# Objective: 
Detection of a electrical panel door using a Intel Realsense camera and Opencv and Scikit learn libraries. 

Project is focused towards incorporating this technology into a drone for assisting it to open the door in air autonomously. 
Drones are being used extensively for surveillance and reconnaissance tasks.
But in the recent past they are also being employed for interacting physically with the environment.
This can involve tasks like picking up packages or boxes, mounting some sensor on a wall or opening doors while hovering.
Several sophisticated end effectors have also been designed for this purpose. 
But for all of them to work the drone needs to identify the target object in front of it.
So the focus of this project is to identify an electrical panel door and its door handle and measure the distance of the drone from it.
This information will be later used (in a separate project) by the drone for controlling its position and the movement of its end effector to grab the door handle and pull open the door.

This project is only about the image processing part to identify and electrical panel door. 
The camera to be used should be small and light, so that it can be put on a drone. So we selected the Intel Realsense Depth camera for this purpose.

# Requirements: 
* Algorithm should be able to run in real time on a laptop as well as on a sigle board computer (without any dependence on GPUs).
* Algorithm should be able to detect the electrical panel door and show the position of the door handle.
* The distance of the door handle from the camera should also be calculated continuously in real time.
* All software should be open source. 
* Overall setup should be battery operated and should be small and light enough to be mounted on a drone. 

# Current Framework: 
* Opencv, SciKit Learn and SciKit Image libraries, Ubuntu 16.04. 
* Intel Realsense R200 Depth Camera.
* Odroid XU4 single board computer, Laptop computer.
